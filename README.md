# Overview of the Simple Calculator Project
<img width="756" alt="ct 1" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ad62e07b-9fc3-4887-8582-252a9a84f87a">

This project is a basic calculator implemented in Python. It allows users to perform fundamental arithmetic operations—addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division—on two numbers. The program is designed to be beginner-friendly, providing a clear structure and easy-to-understand functionality.

# Key Features

1. User Input:
   - The program prompts users to enter two numbers.
   - It checks that the input is valid and numeric.

2. Operation Selection:
   - Users can choose from four arithmetic operations:
     - Addition (+)
     - Subtraction (−)
     - Multiplication (×)
     - Division (÷)
   - The selection is made by entering a corresponding number (1, 2, 3, or 4).

3. Performing Calculations:
   - Based on the user's chosen operation, the program calculates the result.
   - If division is selected, the program checks for division by zero and provides an error message if attempted.

4. Displaying Results:
   - The result of the calculation is displayed in a clear and formatted manner.

5. Error Handling:
   - The program includes basic error handling to manage invalid inputs and prevent crashes.

# Project Structure

The project consists of:
- Functions: Each arithmetic operation is defined in a separate function (add, subtract, multiply, divide), making the code organized and easy to follow.
- Main Program: The `main()` function ties everything together, handling user interaction and the flow of the program.

# How to Use the Program

1. Run the Program: Execute the Python script in your preferred environment.
2. Input Numbers: Follow the prompts to enter two numbers.
3. Choose an Operation**: Select the desired arithmetic operation by entering the corresponding number.
4. View the Result: The program will display the result of the calculation clearly
 
This project serves as a great starting point for anyone new to Python programming, helping to build confidence and understanding in coding fundamentals.
